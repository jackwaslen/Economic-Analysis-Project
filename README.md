# Economic-Analysis-Project
I wanted a project where I could refresh my pandas and matplotlib knowledge, so after a little research I found https://datahub.io/collections and started looking for datasets that interested me. I saw that 'Exchange Rates' and 'Corruption Index' datasets were available, and each dataset required a little extra tweaking before I could use them in my basic analysis. Take a look at the uploaded notebook to see the results (and my notes on the code).
